# Sports Leagues

🔗 **[Live demo](https://test-task-sporty.vercel.app/)**

A single-page application that fetches and displays sports leagues from [TheSportsDB](https://www.thesportsdb.com/), with filtering by name and sport type, and a season badge preview on league selection.


## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

No environment variables required.


## Design Decisions

- **Vue 3** + Vite + TypeScript
- **Pinia** — centralized state management
- **Element Plus** — UI component library


## AI Tools Used

I used AI tools to accelerate execution while keeping full ownership of the final solution.

- ChatGPT: requirement breakdown → task checklist ([docs/TASKS.md](docs/TASKS.md)).
- Claud Code: implemented scoped tasks one-by-one; I reviewed changes and tested the application.
